As part of my DLT talent program with the Frankfurt School of Finance blockchain center, I'm working through a [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/ethereum-and-solidity-the-complete-developers-guide) on programming web applications using blockchain.

- The course is a fantastic introduction into coding with **solidity**, the language used for Ethereum. 
- The course is less fantastic in using up-to-date versions of various libraries. It's rather outdated, so there are many warnings along the way regarding the libraries being  no longer supported. 

I'll keep this Read Me updated as the application takes shape
